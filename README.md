This repository contain some notes on why learning to code is a useful skill (beyond, becuase my advisor said so).

1. Reproducibility
    - Mostly for you, but also for others
    - Have you ever had to re-do analysis?
      - If done point and click, reproducing analysis is laborious, and often does not produce same results
      - Example from my work: N-Sink rasterization <https://github.com/jhollist/nsink_raster>
      - Example from Bio: <https://web.uri.edu/plankton/>
2. Automation
    - If you have to do something more than once, automate it.
      - Example from my work: Watershed Watch <https://github.com/jhollist/green_murky_warm>
3. Code provides very precise description of methods
4. Tools useful beyond just science
5. HUGE demand for capable coders
    - I've had positions go unfilled becuase lack of candidates.
